He does not wish to be named. And we have lost contact with him some time ago.
Other than that. Things to know, things to know..
Oh! So the diamond weighs in about 1.6 pounds and is said to be more valuable than the Cullinan I Diamond.
For context the Cullinan I Diamond costs about 150 million dollars! And was said to be given to Edward VII of England.
I speak alot of the Cullinan I Diamond, but I actually don't know much of the origin of \"Eternal Youth\", it has been rated and confirmed by a gemologist to be of great value.
Anyways. I speak too much. You should see it for yourself.
Have a great day!"
